        <p class="center">Due to climate change and human impacts, coral reef ecosystems around the world are suffering. </p>
        <p class="center">By learning more about the significance of these reefs and how we can protect them, we can each help advocate for the survival of these crucial ocean habitats.</p>

                <h3>biodiversity and protection</h3>
                <p> Tropical coral reefs are some of the oldest and most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, acting as nurseries, refuges, and breeding grounds for at least 25% of known marine species. Scientists are even using plants and animals from the reef to develop new medicines.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">who lives in the reef?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p class="center">Coral reefs are home to a wide variety of organisms, including over 4,000 species of fish, coral, sponges, and crustaceans. Here are a few!</p>

                <p> Different organisms in the coral reef help keep the water clean and clear by filtering sediment.</p>
                <p> Coral reefs help protect nearby carbon sink habitats, like seagrass meadows and mangroves.</p>
                <p> Coral reefs are also protect shorelines against waves, storms, and floods, preventing erosion and damage by acting as a buffer.</p>
                <h3 class="quote">"What happens on one coral reef can affect another coral reef hundreds of miles away. Ocean currents carry coral larvae (babies) from one reef to another, which means that saving coral reefs relies on regional collaboration."</h3>

                <h3>communities near reefs</h3>
                <p>Coral reefs are vital to the livelihoods of over 500 million people worldwide, providing food, jobs, and income through fishing and tourism.</p>
                <p>In many coastal communities, reefs are a source of food security, as they support fisheries that provide a significant portion of the local diet.</p>
                <p>Reefs also contribute to local economies through tourism, attracting millions of visitors each year for activities like snorkeling, diving, and fishing.</p>

                <h3>cultural importance</h3>
                <p>Coral reefs are deeply significant to many cultures, especially in tropical regions where they are intertwined with local beliefs and practices.</p>
                <p>In many Pacific Island cultures, reefs are considered sacred and are integral to their identity, spirituality, and way of life.</p>
                <p>In Hawaii, coral is part of their origin story, and continues to be deeply meaningful.</p>
                <p>Reefs are also important for traditional fishing practices, which have been passed down through generations, connecting communities to their heritage and environment.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>ocean warming</h3>
                <p>Data from around the world show that corals are declining rapidly. The ocean has been warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Corals are sensitive to their environment, and small changes can easily stress them out. When temperatures rise, coral bleaching occurs—corals expel their zooxanthellae and reveal their white skeleton, making them more vulnerable. Climate change has led to an increase in stressful events like heat waves and storms, without sufficient time for corals to recover. Taking action to prevent carbon emission will allow corals to rebound. There are also some resilient corals that have become more heat tolerant, and scientists are working to identify and study these types of corals.</p>

                <h3>ocean acidification</h3>
                <p>The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making the ocean more acidic.</p>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">how does ocean acidification work?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Ocean acidification happens when the ocean absorbs a large amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some of the carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid, which then breaks to release a hydrogen ion. These hydrogen ions make the ocean more acidic. If the addition and removal of carbon dioxide are in equilibrium, there would be no problem—however, today the rate of carbon dioxide addition is 100x faster than removal.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Corals, made of calcium carbonate, are unable to grow their structures in acidic water, and can even be dissolved if it is too acidic. Corals, mollusks, and algae struggling to build shells could be devastating to the marine food web overall. In the future, species may go extinct and coral reefs may be dead, while certain sea grasses and jellyfish will be abundant.</p>

                <h3>human pollution</h3>
                <p>There are many examples of plastic and chemical pollution by humans that have harmed reefs.</p>
                <p>Plastic pollution is a major threat to coral reefs, as it can smother corals, block sunlight, and introduce harmful chemicals into the ecosystem. Marine animals can mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement.</p>
                <img src="static/plastic.jpg" alt="A plastic bag floats through the reef." id="reef-sunscreen-image">                
                <p>Chemical pollution, such as fertilizers and pesticides from agriculture, can lead to nutrient runoff into the ocean. Herbicides were introduced in Hawai'i to support the sugar cane industry, but this led to sodium arsenite in the water harming the reef.</p>
                <p>When sediment is dumped into the ocean, it clouds up the water, allowing less sunlight to pass through. This prevents the algae from performing photosynthesis, and as a result, reefs have less oxygen and more waste.</p>

                <h3>safe sun protection</h3>
                <p>When snorkeling and swimming near the reef, do not use sunscreen that has ingredients toxic to coral!</p>
                <p>Use reef-safe sunscreen that does not contain oxybenzone or octinoxate. These chemicals accumulate in tissues of many marine organisms impairing growth and damaging their bodily systems, threatening the health of coral reefs.</p>
                <p>When possible, it's best to avoid sunscreen entirely. The safest sun protection while snorkeling is UPF clothing like a rash guard.</p>

                <p>Check out Save the Reef's sunscreen guide to ensure your sunscreen is safe:</p>

                <h3>responsible snorkeling</h3>
                <p>Many snorkelers unknowingly harm the reef. Though these may be small incidents, many incidents over a period time leads to structural changes in the reef.</p>
                <p>When snorkeling, be sure to follow these best practices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not touch or stand on coral.</li>
                    <li>Avoid kicking up sand or sediment.</li>
                    <li>Do not touch, chase, harass, or feed marine life.</li>
                    <li>Use a flotation device if you are not a strong swimmer.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
                    <li>Swim horizontally without using arms to minimize disturbance.</li>
                    <li>Take nothing out of the water (except for recent garbage).</li>
                    <li>Choose a guide or tour operator that follows responsible practices.</li>
                </ul>
