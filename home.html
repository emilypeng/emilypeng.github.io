        <p class="info">hi! my name is emily and reefly is my capstone advocacy project for advanced ecological studies 2024-2025. </p>
        <p class="info">this year, we studied the different organisms that live in tropical coral reefs, and how each part of the reef is interconnected and vital. we also learned about some of the human impacts that can harm coral reefs. on our trip to french polynesia, we experienced firsthand the wonder and beauty of snorkeling in these reefs. however, we also saw that the effects of climate change and human pollution have taken a toll on these incredible ecosystems.</p>
        <p class="info">this website places a focus on what an individual traveler or snorkeler can do to avoid harming the reef. these simple actions can contribute to the protection and restoration of reefs that scientists are working hard towards. geared towards anyone traveling or spending time near coral reefs, i hope that these tips inspire a greater appreciation for the amazing reef and provide a means to protect it.</p>
